<p align="justify">
This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing restaurant sales performance using real transactional data collected from multiple cities across the world. The dataset provides detailed information about sales transactions, customer behaviors, product performance, and store management. Data cleaning and preparation were conducted using <b>Excel</b>, while the visualization and analysis were built using <b>Tableau</b>. The dashboard answers key business questions such as preferred payment methods, top selling products, city level revenue contributions, manager performance, revenue trends over time, and statistical measures like averages, variances, and standard deviations. This project demonstrates how raw sales data can be transformed into a professional, insight-driven dashboard that supports strategic business decisions and operational improvements.
